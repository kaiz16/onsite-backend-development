### Week 12: Databases Part 2 + Expressjs + Serverless functions (extras/optional)

**Day 1**:

- Mentor Sharing Topic & Demo: Introduction to REST APIs and CRUD operations
- Topics To Be Self-Covered: Creating an Express.js app, defining routes, handling requests and responses
- Task Of The Day: Build a simple REST API that performs CRUD operations for a todolist
  - Retrieve a list of all todos (GET /todos)
  - Retrieve a single todo (GET /todos/:id)
  - Create a new todo (POST /todos)
  - Update an existing todo (PUT /todos/:id)
  - Delete a todo (DELETE /todos/:id)
  - Have at least 30 todos and implement pagination + sorting feature to GET /todos route

- Take Home Tasks:
  - Create a new route that retrieves the total count of todos and sends it as a response.
  - Create a route that filters the todos based on their status (e.g., pending) and returns the filtered list.
  - Add validation to the POST /todos and PUT /todos/:id routes using middleware. You can use third party middleware or create from scratch.
  - Add logging to all routes so that you can see the request body, path params, query params, time of the request and user-agent string (browserâ€™s information).
