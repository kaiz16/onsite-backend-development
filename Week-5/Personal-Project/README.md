### Instructions

To complete the Sigma School Backend Development Programme, you will be building the full REST API for the personal project of your choice. It should be an individual project. By the end of next week, you should have a fully functional API that make use of all the concepts you have learned throughout the programme. You may be required to share your work with others.

### Project Ideas

You should choose a project that you are passionate about. It should be something that you will be proud to show off to others. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Spending Tracker
- Blog Platform
- Pet Adoption Platform
- URL Shortener
- File Sharing Platform
- Recipe Sharing Platform
- etc

Alternatively, you may ask ChatGPT for ideas.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
- Sequelize
- MySQL Workbench or Beekeeper Studio
- Insomnia or Postman
- Completed Twitter Clone Frontend
- Completed Twitter Clone Backend
- Completed all modules in the Backend Development Programme

## Project Requirements

- Your project should have authentication and authorization.
- Your project should have a minimum of 3 models.
- Your project should use Sequelize ORM to interact with the database.
- Your project should have two database. One for development and one for production.
- Your project should have two environments. One for development and one for production.
- Your project should use `.env` files to store environment variables and secrets.
- Your project should use MVC principles.
- Your project should have two Dockerfiles. One for development and one for production.
- Finally, your project should be deployed to Google Cloud Run.
- Optionally, you may use mailgun or any other email service to send emails.

## Timeline

### Session One:

1. Brainstorm and Plan the Project

   - Planning and designing the ERD diagram
   - Planning and designing the database schema
   - Auth mechanisms
   - Deployment strategy

2. Project Setup

   - Setup database migrations

3. Setup Authentication
   - Implement authentication middleware

### Session Two:

1. Setup Remaining Models

2. Implement Controllers and Routes

3. Test API Endpoints

### Session Three:

1. Secure API Endpoints

   - Implement authorization middleware

2. Final Testing and Debugging

   - Test all API endpoints
   - Debug and fix any issues

3. Deploy API to Google Cloud Run
   - Write documentation in README.md
   - Deploy API to Google Cloud Run

Once you have completed the project, you should have a fully functional REST API

You will be required to share your work with others.

## Project Setup

You may re-use [Twitter Clone Backend](https://replit.com/team/coding-fundamentals1/Day-40-Twitter-Clone-API) as a starting point for your project. Alternatively, you may start from scratch. If you choose to start from scratch, you will need to setup the project yourself. However, if you choose to re-use Twitter Clone Backend, you will need to make some changes to the codebase.
