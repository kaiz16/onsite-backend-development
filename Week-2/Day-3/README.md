## Topics To Be Self-Covered:

## Task Of The Day:

Build a Task Management System

- Overview

  - There are three user roles in the system: admin, manager, and employee.
  - Projects have a name, description, start and expected end dates.
  - Tasks belong to a project. Tasks have a name, description, status, and due date.
  - Projects are assigned to managers by admins.
  - Tasks can be assigned to employees by managers.

- Database Schema:  
   **Goal**: Using Beekeeper Studio, come up with the database schema for a task management system.

  - Figure out the entities involved in the System. Eg: users, tasks, projects, and user roles.
  - Figure out the relationships between the entities. For instance, a user can have multiple tasks assigned to them, and a project can have multiple tasks associated with it.
  - Define the attributes and data types for each entity.
  - Hint: Draw out the ERD diagram first and then create the schema.

- Models:  
   **Goal**: Create the Sequelize models for all entities in the database.

  - Create a separate model file for each entity in the system, following the MVC pattern
  - Show the relationships between the models. For example, a user may have a foreign key to reference their assigned tasks.

- MVC Pattern:  
   **Goal**: Implement proper MVC pattern
  - Keep in mind the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern while designing the database schema and models.
  - The models should exactly represent the entities in the database schema.
  - The views and controllers are not required for this task.
  - Use environment variables to store the database credentials.
  - Add logging using Morgan middleware to log all requests to the console. The log should include the request body, path params, query params, time of the request, and user-agent string (browserâ€™s information).

## Take Home Tasks:

- Implement the controllers and routes for the Task Management System.
- Implement validations where appropriate.
