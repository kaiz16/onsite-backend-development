## Task Of The Day:

Build a simple REST API that performs CRUD operations for a todolist

- Retrieve a list of all todos (GET /todos)
- Retrieve a single todo (GET /todos/:id)
- Create a new todo (POST /todos)
- Update an existing todo (PUT /todos/:id)
- Delete a todo (DELETE /todos/:id)
- Have at least 30 todos and implement pagination + sorting feature to GET /todos route

## Take Home Tasks:

- Create a new route that retrieves the total count of todos and sends it as a response.
- Create a route that filters the todos based on their status (e.g., pending) and returns the filtered list.
- Add validation to the POST /todos and PUT /todos/:id routes using middleware. You can use third party middleware or create from scratch.
- Add logging to all routes so that you can see the request body, path params, query params, time of the request and user-agent string (browserâ€™s information).
