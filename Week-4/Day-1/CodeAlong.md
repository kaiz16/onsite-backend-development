### Code Along: Implementing Forgot Password Feature

Letâ€™s implement the forgot password feature by using Mailgun in our application.

We'll use sandbox domain for development environment and production domain for production environment.

You can download the starter code [here](https://replit.com/team/coding-fundamentals1/Day-37-Task-of-the-Day-Solution).

Once downloaded, follow the steps below:

1. Change directory to the starter code folder.  
   `cd task-management-api-totd`
2. Install dependencies.  
   `npm install`
3. Open the current directory in VS Code.  
   `code .`
4. Run the `migration.dev.sql` in db folder to setup the database for development environment.
5. Run the `migration.prod.sql` in db folder to setup the database for production environment.
6. Run the application in development mode.  
   `npm run start`
7. Import the `Insomnia_[date].json` file into Insomnia.
